            <h3>History</h3>
            <img src="IMAGES/journey.webp">
            <p>
                The story of COMET Services began as a voluntary service in 1995
                (at Assam Rifles campus, Shillong), with mentoring and coaching of
                2-3 students. With my ongoing persistent contributions and with some
                support from few professionals from different fields, it has now
                taken the shape of an ed-tech career counseling and training institute,
                helping 100s of needy students from various parts of the country like
                northeast Indian states, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Uttarakhand.
                <br><br><br>
                Today, we are privileged to connect with 1000s of students,
                which allows us to transform the career of the needy students
                into a glorious success story.

            <h4>Why COMET Services</h4>
            <img src="IMAGES/wcs.png">
            <p>
                In most educational institutes, students are fully occupied with academic
                studies without considering career development. This flaw in our education
                system prohibits students in achieving their goals as per their best abilities.
                Such gaps related to proper educational guidance and career development needs
                are more severe in remote places, either due to environmental factors or due
                to financial reasons.
                <br><br><br>
                COMET service works towards resolving these gaps for the success of every student,
                by helping students in shaping their career plan best, and also helping educational
                institutes to glorify their wall of fame with success stories of ex-students.
            </p>

        <div class="heading-right">
            <h4>COMET Mission</h4>
            <img src="IMAGES/mission.jfif">
            <p>
                Our mission is to provide high-quality, effective, and affordable counseling to
                help students in transforming their skills and abilities into success stories.
                We take the privilege to walk alongside our students as they navigate the
                uncertainties and challenges of life. Amid their challenges, we provide COMET
                support and work towards motivating and empowering all students to move ahead
                in their career path.
                <br><br><br>
                We also aim to enable educational institutes to have their glorifying wall of
                fame with success stories of students. We facilitate this by working with
                educational institutes collaboratively.

                Our sincere interest is to do best for every student, helping them to reach their

                This directly helps educational institutes also in glorifying their wall of fame and
                creating more success stories for the glory of the institute.
